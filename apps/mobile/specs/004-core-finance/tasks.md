# Tasks: Home, Accounts, Transactions, and Categories

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/004-core-finance/`

**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/core-finance-contract.md`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Required by the project constitution for financial arithmetic, validation, state
transitions, storage mutations, privacy, accessibility, and each critical user journey. Write the
named test before its implementation task and confirm it fails for the intended missing behavior.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story. Every task names the exact file to change and
an independent verification target suitable for a lower-cost implementation model.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: May run in parallel because it changes a different file and has no dependency on an incomplete task.
- **[Story]**: Maps the task to a user story in `spec.md`.
- Run the narrowest named test after each implementation task; do not wait for the phase checkpoint.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Add only the project checks and test support required by SPEC-004.

- [X] T001 Create `scripts/check-core-finance-boundaries.mjs` to reject direct SQLite imports outside `src/storage/`, feature-local raw colors, hard-coded English UI strings in SPEC-004 feature/routes, sensitive financial logging, and production-provider imports; verify with `node scripts/check-core-finance-boundaries.mjs`.
- [X] T002 Add `check:core-finance` to `package.json` pointing to `scripts/check-core-finance-boundaries.mjs`; verify with `npm run check:core-finance`.
- [X] T003 [P] Update `src/test-utils/render.tsx` to create an isolated QueryClient per render and expose a helper for preloaded query data without changing existing callers; verify with `npm test -- --runInBand src/test-utils/render.test.tsx` after adding the focused regression in that file.
- [X] T004 [P] Create `src/test-utils/core-finance-fixtures.ts` with deterministic synthetic accounts, all default category groups, and factories for empty, partial, multi-currency, archived, offline, conflict, and 500-transaction datasets; verify exported fixture counts and unique IDs in `src/test-utils/core-finance-fixtures.test.ts`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Establish one typed, durable ledger boundary shared by all five user stories.

**CRITICAL**: Complete this phase before any user-story implementation.

- [X] T005 [P] Write failing tests for integer minor-unit parsing, formatting inputs, safe-integer limits, transaction balance effects, and derived account balance in `src/domain/core-finance.test.ts`; verify failures target missing SPEC-004 domain functions.
- [X] T006 Implement MoneyValue, account/category/transaction/draft/filter/correction/conflict/HomeSummary types and pure balance-effect functions in `src/domain/core-finance.ts` until `src/domain/core-finance.test.ts` passes.
- [X] T007 Write failing Zod validation tests for account, category hierarchy, transaction, transfer, refund, draft, and conflict-resolution inputs in `src/domain/core-finance-validation.test.ts`; include same-account transfer, missing bilingual labels, cycles, invalid amounts, and archived selections.
- [X] T008 Add the validation schemas and localized issue-key mapping to `src/domain/core-finance.ts`; verify `npm test -- --runInBand src/domain/core-finance-validation.test.ts`.
- [X] T009 Write a failing migration test in `src/storage/database.test.ts` that upgrades schema version 1 to SPEC-004 tables/indexes with foreign keys enabled and preserves existing `offline_entries` rows.
- [X] T010 Extend `src/storage/database.ts` with one forward-only migration for accounts, categories, transactions, drafts, correction actions, exchange-rate fixtures, and sync conflicts plus required indexes; verify `src/storage/database.test.ts` and do not rewrite migration 1.
- [X] T011 Write failing repository tests for account/category CRUD, default-account uniqueness, transaction CRUD, durable drafts, foreign-key rejection, and transaction rollback in `src/storage/core-finance-repository.test.ts`.
- [X] T012 Implement the minimum repository operations required by T011 in `src/storage/core-finance-repository.ts`, keeping every direct SQLite call in this file or `src/storage/database.ts`; verify `src/storage/core-finance-repository.test.ts`.
- [X] T013 [P] Define CoreFinanceService, ExchangeRateService, typed inputs/results, query scopes, impact previews, and safe error codes in `src/services/contracts/core-finance-service.ts`; verify with `npm run typecheck`.
- [X] T014 Implement a deterministic repository-backed mock CoreFinanceService skeleton in `src/services/mocks/core-finance-service.ts` that satisfies T013 without adding user-story mutations yet; verify with `npm run typecheck`.
- [X] T015 [P] Write failing tests for stable query keys and mutation-scope invalidation in `src/features/core-finance/core-finance-queries.test.ts`; cover Home, lists, details, selectors, and conflicts.
- [X] T016 Implement query keys, query options, and mutation invalidation helpers in `src/features/core-finance/core-finance-queries.ts`; verify `src/features/core-finance/core-finance-queries.test.ts` and keep durable records out of Zustand.
- [X] T017 [P] Write safe error-mapping tests in `src/features/core-finance/core-finance-errors.test.ts` proving storage/provider details and financial values never appear in user messages or analytics payloads.
- [X] T018 Implement localized retry, keep-editing, save-local, and review-conflict mappings in `src/features/core-finance/core-finance-errors.ts`; verify `src/features/core-finance/core-finance-errors.test.ts`.

**Checkpoint**: The database, domain rules, typed service boundary, query ownership, fixtures, and safe errors are ready; all user stories may now start.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understand My Financial Position (Priority: P1) MVP

**Goal**: Replace Home placeholder content with a trustworthy derived financial summary and one clear next action.

**Independent Test**: Load empty, populated, hidden, multi-currency, partial, offline, error, review, and pending-sync fixtures; Home must show the correct hierarchy, estimates/exclusions, privacy behavior, and recovery without requiring another story's UI.

- [X] T107 Run all static and automated commands from `specs/004-core-finance/quickstart.md`, fix only SPEC-004 failures, and record command versions/results in `specs/004-core-finance/validation-results.md`.
- [ ] T108 Execute Android quickstart scenarios on a development build, including offline, keyboard, app restart during undo, hidden app-switcher preview, 200% text, RTL/LTR, light/dark, reduced motion, and TalkBack; record device/version and pass/fail evidence in `specs/004-core-finance/validation-results.md`.
- [ ] T109 Execute iOS quickstart scenarios on macOS/Xcode for platform parity, VoiceOver, safe areas, keyboard, lifecycle, RTL/LTR, themes, and 200% text; record evidence or leave this task unchecked with the exact environment blocker in `specs/004-core-finance/validation-results.md`.
- [ ] T110 Re-run the complete stop-condition review in `specs/004-core-finance/quickstart.md` and mark SPEC-004 ready only when `specs/004-core-finance/validation-results.md` contains no silent/partial financial change, privacy exposure, conflict overwrite, misleading estimate, or accessibility failure.

## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 Setup**: Starts immediately. T002 depends on T001; T003 and T004 may run in parallel.
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: Depends on Phase 1 and blocks every user story. Follow each test task with its named implementation task.
- **US1-US5**: Depend on Phase 2. They are independently testable, but sequential execution is recommended for one lower-cost model to avoid concurrent edits to shared service, repository, and localization files.
- **Phase 8 Polish**: Depends on every user story selected for release; T107-T110 run in order.

### User Story Dependency Graph

```text
Setup -> Foundation -> US1 Home (MVP)
                    -> US2 Ledger and correction
                    -> US3 Manual entry and conflicts
                    -> US4 Accounts
                    -> US5 Categories

US1 + US2 + US3 + US4 + US5 -> Cross-cutting verification
```

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1**: Uses foundational account/transaction fixtures and services; no other story UI required.
- **US2**: Uses foundational ledger/repository; no Home or manual-entry UI required.
- **US3**: Uses foundational accounts/categories as selectable data; full US4/US5 management UI is not required.
- **US4**: Uses foundational ledger effects; US1-US3 screens are not required for account management tests.
- **US5**: Uses foundational transaction references; US1-US4 screens are not required for category management tests.

### Within Each User Story

1. Write the named failing tests.
2. Implement repository/service behavior before feature UI.
3. Implement shared component hardening before screen composition.
4. Add route wrappers after feature tests pass.
5. Add both language catalogs before the story checkpoint.
6. Run the story's independent test and all previously completed story tests.

## Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel after T001-T002 ownership is clear.
- **Foundation**: T005, T007, T009, T011, T013, T015, and T017 target different test/contract files, but their implementations should land in task order.
- **US1**: T019-T022 are parallel test files; T026, T027, and T029 are separate implementation files after services are ready.
- **US2**: T031-T038 are parallel test files; T041, T043, T045, and T049 are separate implementation files after repository behavior is ready.
- **US3**: T051-T060 are parallel test files; T068-T071 are separate UI/localization files after mutation behavior is ready.
- **US4**: T073-T077 are parallel test files; T079-T081 and T085 are separate implementation files after account service behavior is ready.
- **US5**: T087-T091 are parallel test files; T094-T096 and T100 are separate implementation files after category service behavior is ready.
- **Polish**: T102-T105 are independent verification files and can run in parallel.

## Parallel Execution Examples

### User Story 1

Run T019, T020, T021, and T022 in parallel; then execute T023-T030 in order except T026, T027,
and T029 may be assigned separately after T025.

### User Story 2

Run T031-T038 in parallel; complete T039-T040; then T041, T043, T045, and T049 may proceed in
parallel before route and delete integration tasks finish.

### User Story 3

Run T051-T060 in parallel; execute T061-T067 in order; then T068-T071 may proceed in parallel
before T072 integrates the Add route.

### User Story 4

Run T073-T077 in parallel; execute T078; then T079-T081 and T085 may proceed in parallel before
T082-T084 and T086 complete the journey.

### User Story 5

Run T087-T091 in parallel; execute T092-T093; then T094-T096 and T100 may proceed in parallel
before T097-T099 and T101 complete the journey.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First

1. Complete T001-T018.
2. Complete T019-T030 for US1.
3. Stop and validate the Home checkpoint on real empty/populated/hidden/multi-currency fixtures.
4. Do not begin another story until US1 and all foundation tests pass.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation + US1: trustworthy Home MVP.
2. Add US2: discoverable and correctable ledger.
3. Add US3: universal manual/offline capture.
4. Add US4: full account management.
5. Add US5: full category management.
6. Complete T102-T110 before claiming SPEC-004 complete.

### Lower-Cost Model Execution Rules

- Execute tasks strictly by ID unless the task is explicitly marked `[P]` and assigned to a separate worker.
- Read the named test, contract section, and data-model entity before editing the implementation file.
- Do not combine adjacent tasks, rename planned files, add dependencies, or broaden SPEC-004 scope.
- After each task, run its exact narrow verification and keep the checkbox unchecked if it fails.
- Preserve unrelated dirty-worktree changes and never rewrite earlier migrations.
- Stop at each checkpoint and report the first failing command with its relevant output.
