# UI Contract: R03 Category Presentation and Selection

This contract defines presentation boundaries only. Existing category domain/service/repository behavior remains authoritative.

## 1. Category Identity Contract

Inputs: localized label, optional icon/color, kind, parent context, favorite, status, optional merge target, and current action/selection callback.

- Label is authoritative; icon/color never carry identity alone.
- Category icon does not mirror in RTL; navigation disclosure mirrors when required.
- Duplicate labels remain allowed and are distinguishable through supplied hierarchy/kind/status context.
- Long labels reflow at 200% text and controls remain at least 44×44.

## 2. Management List Contract

- Uses normalized bilingual search and native virtualization.
- Includes current system/custom, favorite, active, archived, and merged records.
- Distinguishes no custom categories from no search results.
- Create and detail navigation remain current routes.
- No usage, recency, restriction, sync, or freshness label is invented.

## 3. Create/Edit Contract

- Persistent Arabic/English labels, searchable parent choice/no-parent, favorite, and one Save action.
- Existing validation/service command is authoritative.
- Duplicate labels are valid; invalid required/hierarchy input remains actionable.
- Existing icon/color values are preserved when not edited.
- Dirty dismissal uses local confirmation; duplicate Save is blocked.

## 4. Archive/Restore Contract

The decision names the category, current status, future selection consequence, and existing historical behavior. Confirmation invokes `setCategoryStatus`; working/failure/success is truthful and not optimistic.

## 5. Merge Contract

- Source and selected active target are visible and unambiguous.
- Consequence states existing transaction reclassification and source archive.
- One selected target and explicit confirmation are required.
- Presentation invokes `mergeCategory` and does not inspect or mutate transactions.
- Failure preserves the decision for retry; success follows current invalidation/navigation.

## 6. Picker Contract

Controlled inputs/callbacks: current selection, active eligible categories, optional supplied recent list, favorites, normalized search, `onSelect`, `onCancel`, and optional caller-supported create handoff.

R03 owns selection presentation. The caller owns its transaction/proposal/filter draft and applies the result. Archived/merged categories are not selectable.

## 7. State and Error Mapping

- Query initial → loading.
- No custom categories → management empty guidance while system categories remain.
- Search no result → preserve query and clear/revise action.
- Missing detail/query/storage failure → mapped error/back/retry.
- Category lifecycle → active/archive/merged from Category.
- Synchronization/freshness → not shown because not supplied.

## 8. Direction, Access, Privacy, and Motion

- Arabic/English contain identical identity, fields, consequences, actions, and recovery.
- Mixed labels/digits remain intentionally ordered.
- Screen-reader output includes label, kind, hierarchy, favorite/selection, status, availability, and action.
- Keyboard/safe area keeps parent picker/form actions reachable.
- Status/selection/merge meaning is not color/icon/motion-only.
- Standard motion is brief; reduced motion presents final state immediately.

## 9. Ownership Matrix

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Shared tokens, form, grouped row, picker, modal, confirmation | R01 |
| Category identity/list/form/detail/picker/merge presentation | R03 |
| Category validation, hierarchy, lifecycle, merge and reclassification | Existing core finance |
| Caller draft and applying picker result | R04/R05/other caller |
