# Acceptance Traceability — SPEC-BE-002

## Implemented local evidence

- AC-005/SC-003: migrations 005-013 and pgTAP 004-008 cover six owned tables, functions, forced RLS, least grants, and owner/non-owner/Admin negatives; latest local result: 8 files, 308 tests.
- AC-007: runtime OpenAPI drift passes for all ten operations; DTO/contract suites and real-database HTTP E2E cover two-owner profile/preferences and onboarding flows.
- AC-008/SC-006: crypto, registration race/rotation, local-first revoke, recent auth, provider retry, and device E2E tests pass locally.
- AC-009/SC-004: official signed ingress, durable duplicate/hash conflict, current-state worker convergence, concurrent claims, provider rollback, reconciliation, and seven-day redaction pass with local fixtures.
- AC-010: active-profile database assertion and inactive lifecycle tests fail closed.
- AC-012: bounded metrics, redaction checks, and both recovery runbooks exist; dashboard/tabletop evidence remains open.
- AC-013: additive ordered migrations exist; final checksum/N-1/forward-recovery run remains open.
- AC-014: mapping-only contract and no-client-diff/Admin-denial tests pass; SPEC-BE-003/014 work remains deferred.

## Release blockers

- AC-001/AC-002: exact SMS allowlist is blocked by Clerk plan; Android is configured, while the Apple Team ID required for iOS is unavailable.
- AC-003/AC-004/AC-006/SC-001: Clerk native Supabase integration is enabled and no legacy JWT Template exists; hosted Supabase Third-Party Auth plus two Phone/one Google protected identities remain unavailable for a real token matrix.
- AC-011: production-like SQL runs used the profile primary keys, device cursor index, and webhook claim/retention indexes under the 50 ms DB budget. Authenticated identity k6 requires protected provider tokens and all remaining k6 was explicitly skipped by the user; it is not a pass.
- AC-015: dependency audit, SAST, repository/history/image secret scans, and release-container checks pass locally; remote CI/SBOM/signature/provenance remains open.
- SC-002/SC-005/SC-007/SC-008: locally covered in part; final provider and release evidence remains open.

FR-001..FR-045 map to tasks T001..T145 in `tasks.md`; unchecked tasks remain explicit evidence gaps and are not inferred as passes.

## Fresh command evidence — 2026-08-28

- Live local `npm run verify`: pass with all database tests enabled; unit 171/171, contract 83/83, integration 48/48, E2E 18/18, security 50/50, build, migration checksums, and dependency audit all pass.
- `npm run db:lint && npm run test:db`: no schema errors; 8 files and 308 pgTAP assertions pass.
- `npm run test:release-image`: 4 suites and 9 container assertions pass.
- Production-like SQL: profile lookup 0.036 ms, preferences lookup 0.023 ms, device cursor 0.059 ms, webhook claim 0.036 ms, and retention 0.051 ms in the final recorded local run; all used the intended indexes after forward migration 013 and removed their own fixtures.
- Clean-state rehearsal: local reset reapplied migrations 001-013; schema lint passed; pgTAP passed 8 files/308 assertions; migration apply/checksum/concurrency/backup-restore passed 4/4.
- Provider recovery rehearsal: live-database integration passed 18 suites/48 tests, including Clerk outage, reconciliation, webhook crash/retry/retention, and device session recovery.
- Completed load evidence: outbox 4,791 iterations with zero claim failures (P95 18 ms/P99 53 ms); webhook 600 requests with only 202/expected 429 responses (P95 7.045 ms/P99 15.063 ms). Remaining k6 is skipped by explicit user instruction and not counted as a release pass.
- Clerk provider evidence: native Supabase integration reports Enabled; JWT Templates reports 0 items; OIDC issuer/JWKS match the approved asymmetric instance. Hosted Supabase and real-token proof remain blocked on reauthentication/test identities.
