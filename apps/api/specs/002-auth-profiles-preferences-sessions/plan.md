# Implementation Plan: Authentication, Profiles, Preferences & Sessions

**Phase / Spec**: Phase 02 / SPEC-BE-002
**Branch**: `main`
**Base Revision**: `d17d140e0eaf0270895c7fbe1dc25d84e2d9bb0f` (`origin/main`)
**Date**: 2026-08-28
**Status**: Governance transition to `main` pending; implementation not started
**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: SPEC-BE-002 specification and `docs/Back end/BACKEND_MASTER_PLAN.md`

## Summary

Implement one Clerk trust boundary for the NestJS API, keep Clerk as the sole
identity/session authority, and store only Masarifi-owned profile, preference,
onboarding, device, protected push-token, and webhook synchronization state in
Supabase PostgreSQL. Protected API requests use the official Clerk backend SDK,
then establish transaction-local verified claims for forced RLS on direct `pg`
queries. Clerk webhooks are verified from raw bytes, inserted once into a private
inbox, and reconciled asynchronously against current Clerk state. All state events
reuse SPEC-BE-001's outbox.

The implementation adds one identity module and one official provider dependency.
It reuses Node `crypto`, the current PostgreSQL pool, shared configuration/error/
OpenAPI/observability boundaries, API/worker entry points, database roles, version
trigger, outbox, test projects, container, and CI. It adds no ORM, Supabase client,
Redis, cache, service, session table, auth-user mirror, idempotency table, queue,
view, or client cutover.

## Implementation Gate

SPEC-BE-001 is merged into `origin/main` at
`d17d140e0eaf0270895c7fbe1dc25d84e2d9bb0f`. Before implementation, integrate
these SPEC-BE-002 artifacts into the existing `main` checkout without creating a
worktree, then recheck source, migration, pgTAP, Docker, CI, role, outbox, and
client-contract paths. The repository has templates but no
`check-prerequisites.ps1`, so prerequisite discovery remains a documented manual
fallback and does not alter the implementation contract.

## Technical Context

**Language / Runtime**: TypeScript 5.9 on Node.js `>=24 <25`
**Framework**: NestJS 11 with Express adapter and separate API/worker entry points
**Primary Dependencies**: existing NestJS/`pg`/Joi/class-validator/Swagger/OTel;
add current compatible `@clerk/backend` only; Node `crypto` for push protection
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL public owner tables, private Clerk inbox, existing
SPEC-BE-001 roles/version trigger/outbox/PGMQ publication
**Testing**: Jest unit/contract/integration/E2E/security/container, pgTAP/RLS,
OpenAPI/event drift, k6/performance and recovery procedures
**Target Platform**: existing non-root immutable backend container and Supabase
deployment; runtime secret injection only
**Project Type**: NestJS modular monolith with separate API and worker entry points
**Performance Goals**: indexed identity lookup <=50 ms P95 DB; `/me` and
preference/onboarding <=250 ms P95, <=500 ms P99, <=50 KiB compressed; bounded
device pages <=100 with no N+1; bounded webhook backlog/redaction work
**Constraints**: Clerk only; native Supabase Third-Party Auth; no Supabase Auth
identity/JWT Template/password/extra provider; forced RLS; active-profile denial;
no secret/JWT/OTP/PII logging; no direct Admin grants; no client source change;
no durable generic idempotency until SPEC-BE-006
**Scale / Scope**: one profile and preference row per Clerk user, optional onboarding
row, multiple devices/tokens and at-least-once provider deliveries; capacity is
proven with production-like data rather than an invented MAU target

## Constitution Check

*GATE: evaluated before Phase 0. `PASS` permits planning; the independent
implementation hold above remains binding.*

| Gate | Status | Evidence / disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Main-first baseline | PENDING | Switch the existing checkout to synchronized `main`, preserve unrelated files, and record the resulting revision before T007 |
| Required Spec Kit sequence | PASS through tasks | `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` exist; cross-artifact analysis is the final pre-code gate |
| Exclusive owned resources | PASS | Ownership register matches Phase 02; no Admin/authz/audit/privacy/client/idempotency resource is added |
| Current code and client contracts reviewed | PASS | Merged BE-001 source/tests and current Mobile auth/onboarding plus Admin mock projections were inspected |
| Master Plan architecture represented | PASS | Nest API/worker, direct PostgreSQL, RLS, migrations, outbox, contracts, Docker, evidence, rollback, and operations are explicit |
| Financial/idempotency/conflict rules | PASS | No financial path exists; optimistic versions and natural repeatability are explicit; durable replay remains SPEC-BE-006 |
| Deny-by-default security | PASS | Official Clerk verification, active-profile guard, forced RLS, least grants, raw webhook verification, crypto, safe errors, abuse bounds, and blockers are designed |
| AI boundary | PASS / N/A | No AI work exists |
| Client ownership | PASS | Mobile/Admin source and mocks are mapping-only and remain unchanged; cutover is SPEC-BE-014 |
| Named verification/recovery evidence | PASS | [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) and the Evidence Plan name commands, environments, thresholds, and blocker outcomes |

No Constitution deviation is approved or required. The main-baseline transition
blocks implementation, not this design-only Phase 0/1 work.

```

**Structure decision**: Keep one cohesive `identity` module, one repository, one
service, and one customer controller instead of creating submodules/interfaces for
each small resource. Separate webhook ingress/worker and push crypto only because
they have different trust boundaries and runtimes. Reuse every platform facility
already owned by BE-001. No speculative abstraction or new infrastructure is
planned.

## Ownership And Boundaries

### Owned resources

- Tables: `profiles`, `user_preferences`, `onboarding_progress`, `user_devices`,
  `push_tokens`, `private.clerk_webhook_events`.
- Functions: `public.current_clerk_user_id()`,
  `private.assert_active_profile(text)`.
- Trigger attachments: BE-001 lifecycle trigger on mutable owned tables.
- APIs: nine customer operations plus one webhook ingress operation in
  [contracts/openapi.yaml](contracts/openapi.yaml).
- Job: `clerk.webhook.process`, including current-Clerk reconciliation, bounded
  seven-day redaction, and linked-session revoke retry.
- Events: the five contracts in [contracts/events.md](contracts/events.md).
- Configuration: one Clerk application/provider/native/redirect/native-Supabase
  contract and the environment names in [contracts/environment.md](contracts/environment.md).

### Consumed contracts

- SPEC-BE-001 API/worker bootstrap, configuration schema, `PoolService`, HTTP
  validation/error/request-ID/OpenAPI handling, `META_TOKEN_VERIFIER`, observability,
  roles/schemas, version trigger, outbox/queue publisher, Docker/CI/test commands.
- Clerk Development application, official Backend SDK, Admin API, signed webhooks,
  Native Applications, Phone OTP and Google configuration.
- Supabase native Clerk Third-Party Auth, `auth.jwt()`, PostgreSQL/RLS/pgTAP.
- Current Mobile Phone/Google `AuthService`, text `userId`, onboarding vocabulary,
  secure-storage/deep-link expectations; current Admin masked projections only.

### Explicit exclusions

- Admin roles/permissions/routes, profile suspension/reactivation, audit/security
  events, privacy export, deletion execution: SPEC-BE-003.
- Currency catalog/FK: SPEC-BE-004.
- Durable generic idempotency/offline sync/conflicts: SPEC-BE-006.
- Mobile/Admin Clerk packages, public environment wiring, adapter implementation,
  mock removal, secure client session storage, live deep-link hook: SPEC-BE-014.
- Password, Apple, Facebook, passkeys, local OTP/MFA/OAuth-token storage, Supabase
  Auth users, legacy JWT Template, Masarifi session table, new queue/cache/view.

### Client contract impact

Documentation/mapping only. The API contract is created now so SPEC-BE-014 can
replace Mobile local/mock adapters later. Admin's user/device/session screens remain
mocked until SPEC-BE-003 supplies authorization/routes and SPEC-BE-014 cuts over.
No file under `apps/mobile` or `apps/admin-web` is edited by this Spec.

## Phase 0: Research

[research.md](research.md) resolves every material unknown:

- official Clerk `authenticateRequest()`/`verifyWebhook()` instead of custom JOSE
  or signature code;
- native token `aud`/`azp` semantics and separation from the OAuth callback;
- native Clerk/Supabase integration and text-subject RLS;
- transaction-local RLS claims for direct PostgreSQL;
- duplicate webhook 2xx behavior and `svix-id` identity;
- current-Clerk reconciliation and row-lock ordering without a new watermark/queue;
- standard-library AES-GCM/HMAC push protection;
- natural mutation repeatability until SPEC-BE-006;
- provider/native application configuration and current SMS-tier blocker;
- no Redis/cache/new service/client cutover.

Research corrected the draft specification where current provider semantics made
the original requirement invalid: default Clerk tokens do not require `aud`, native
requests may omit `azp`, identical webhook retries return `202`, and device DELETE
cannot promise `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` without SPEC-BE-006 storage.

## Phase 1: Design And Contracts

- [data-model.md](data-model.md) defines every column, bound, relationship,
  composite same-owner FK, index, lifecycle, RLS/grant matrix, transaction, crypto
  envelope, processing model, migration order, and rollback rule.
- [contracts/openapi.yaml](contracts/openapi.yaml) defines the complete customer and
  provider HTTP fragment, error behavior, pagination, versions, idempotency header,
  webhook duplicate/unsupported behavior, and safe projections.
- [contracts/events.md](contracts/events.md) registers all five v1 payloads inside
  the existing outbox envelope.
- [contracts/environment.md](contracts/environment.md) classifies required secret/
  safe process configuration and fail-closed startup behavior.
- [contracts/provider-configuration.md](contracts/provider-configuration.md)
  provides the redacted Clerk/Supabase dashboard checklist and test identities.
- `contracts/client-mapping.md` is generated during baseline task execution from
  the then-current Mobile/Admin contracts, without changing client source.
- [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) names implementation, provider, database, contract,
  security, performance, container, and recovery verification procedures.

## Key Design Decisions

### One authentication boundary

`ClerkAuthGuard` delegates token verification to the official backend SDK, then
attaches a minimal immutable principal (`userId`, `sessionId`, role, factor age) to
the request. It validates configured audience only if Masarifi later sets one and
validates present `azp` against trusted web origins. A verified native token may
omit `azp`. The guard supplies BE-001's `META_TOKEN_VERIFIER`; no decoded-but-
unverified claim is consumed.

### Active profile plus RLS

The application guard verifies identity; the repository establishes
transaction-local minimal claims and `SET LOCAL ROLE masarifi_api`, then calls the
private active-profile assertion. Forced RLS independently repeats active owner
checks. Direct `authenticated` Data API access is safe SELECT-only; all writes use
the API so DTO allowlists and `expectedVersion` cannot be bypassed. Admin receives
no direct table grant.

### Webhook inbox and current-state convergence

Ingress verifies exact raw bytes and the Standard Webhooks headers through Clerk,
then performs one unique insert. Processing locks one inbox row and one subject
profile in one transaction, reads current Clerk state with a bounded timeout, and
commits profile/default/outbox/inbox effects atomically. A new subject uses a
transaction-local deletion-pending shell so concurrent work serializes on the row;
only a shell inserted by that transaction may become active. Existing inactive
profiles never auto-reactivate. Provider outage rolls back and retries, while
confirmed absence becomes deletion-pending evidence.

This deliberately holds one database transaction across one read-only provider
lookup. It is the only crash-safe design that fits the Master Plan's fixed inbox
columns without adding a queue/lease/watermark object. Load/connection evidence is
blocking; an observed ceiling requires an approved Master Plan/schema change, not
an unreviewed optimization.

### Device and push security

The raw fingerprint becomes a keyed HMAC before persistence. Push tokens use a
separate keyed HMAC and versioned AES-256-GCM envelope with provider/user/device
AAD. Composite FK prevents cross-owner device/token rows. Revocation commits local
device/push denial and an outbox event before calling Clerk; failed linked-session
revocation remains retryable via nonnull session linkage and cannot restore push.

### No false idempotency claim

Every mutation validates `Idempotency-Key`, but durable response replay/hash
mismatch is not implemented here. Conditional versions, natural device uniqueness,
repeated revoked state, and webhook delivery uniqueness give only the repeatability
explicitly documented. SPEC-BE-006 later adds the sole generic store.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Revalidate and extend the foundation

Using the rechecked merged BE-001 source and tests, add
`@clerk/backend`, environment types/schema/examples, route-scoped raw-body parsing,
safe identity errors, composed OpenAPI fragments, and one verifier provider for the
existing meta seam. Fail startup before bind on invalid required secrets/config.

### 2. Apply additive owned migrations

Use Supabase CLI to create descriptive ordered migrations. Build profiles/defaults,
devices/push composite ownership, the private inbox, the two functions, lifecycle
trigger attachments, explicit indexes, forced RLS, and minimum grants. Revoke
defaults first and add positive/negative pgTAP before application writes.

### 3. Establish authentication and RLS request context

Implement the official Clerk client/guard and request principal. In the repository,
wrap each customer operation in a transaction that sets only verified minimal
claims and the API role locally. Prove pooled requests cannot inherit another
subject and that API/worker connections cannot bypass RLS.

### 4. Implement profile, preferences, and onboarding

Add strict DTOs and one controller/service/repository flow. Use conditional UPDATE
with `expectedVersion`, full preference replacement, canonical onboarding steps,
masking, active-profile denial, and same-transaction profile events. Do not read
then decide a concurrent update.

### 5. Implement devices and push protection

Add HMAC fingerprint/token helpers and AES-GCM envelope using Node `crypto`. Add
same-owner atomic register/refresh/reactivation, cursor listing, recent-auth current
device revoke, local push denial, after-commit Clerk session revoke, and retry scan.
Never return or log fingerprint/session/token/hash/ciphertext.

### 6. Implement webhook ingress and worker

Verify raw bytes with `verifyWebhook()`, validate the signed delivery ID and bounded
supported schema, insert once, and handle duplicates/conflicts/unsupported types.
Reuse the BE-001 worker start/abort pattern to claim one row transactionally,
serialize by subject row, fetch current Clerk state, upsert/default without
reactivation, emit events, retry safe failures, reconcile lost events, retry linked
sessions, and redact payloads after seven days.

### 7. Add observability and operational evidence

Extend existing bounded logs/OTel metrics for auth failures, inactive denial,
endpoint/version/device results, webhook inbox/age/attempts, provider latency,
reconciliation drift, session retry, and redaction age. Add two focused runbooks
covering provider/JWKS/native-integration outage/rotation and webhook/device/push
recovery/secret rotation. Labels never contain IDs, claims, or payloads.

### 8. Prove release gates

Run the full named unit/contract/integration/E2E/pgTAP/security/performance/container/
recovery matrix, three protected provider identities, OpenAPI/event/client mapping,
N-1/forward-fix rehearsal, secret/image scan, and provider checklist. Generate
`tasks.md`, run `speckit-analyze`, and resolve every critical/high inconsistency
before any implementation completion claim.

## Evidence Plan

| Gate | Planned evidence | Blocking threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline/dependency | `git branch --show-current`; `git fetch origin main`; `git log --oneline --decorate -10`; dependency ancestry/review | branch exactly `main`; BE-001 present in synchronized baseline; no copied foundation/client/unrelated changes |
| Requirements/contracts | `npm --prefix apps/api run test:contract`; `test:openapi`; event/environment/provider contract tests | zero drift, unknown field, unsafe projection, or undocumented error/event |
| Database/migrations | `db:reset`; `db:lint`; `test:db`; `migration:checksums`; migration E2E | clean ordered apply; all constraints/indexes/checksums; no manual schema drift |
| RLS/authorization | pgTAP matrix plus `security:scope` and identity integration tests | zero owner/non-owner/anon/inactive/Admin cross-access; API/worker no BYPASSRLS |
| Authentication | three controlled test identities; JWT negative/rotation/provider-outage suites | all valid approved sessions accepted; every invalid trust case denied; zero Supabase Auth users |
| Webhook/reconciliation | signed contract/integration/E2E, duplicate/race/crash/outage/loss/redaction tests | 202 after durability, one effect, no regression/loss/plain payload after retention |
| Push/device/session | crypto known-answer/tamper tests, concurrency, cross-owner, recent-auth, outage/retry | zero plaintext/cipher exposure; local revoke always effective; no cross-owner token |
| Security | `security:dependencies`; `security:sast`; secret scan; OWASP/MASVS checklist; image inspection | zero exploitable Critical/High, key/JWT/OTP/PII leak, unsigned/replayed webhook, legacy auth path |
| Performance | production-like k6 plus redacted `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)` | DB <=50 ms P95; API <=250/500 ms P95/P99; <=50 KiB; bounded/no sequential active scan/N+1 |
| Provider configuration | redacted dashboard checklist and approved account aliases | exact providers/countries/native IDs/callback/TPA/domain; SMS restriction resolved for production |
| Containers/operations | `test:container`; `build`; `verify`; non-root/read-only/SIGTERM/readiness tests | no secret/dev dependency; graceful API/worker behavior and fail-closed readiness |
| Rollback/recovery | N-1 image, failed+forward migration, JWKS/provider outage, lost webhook, key/session retry drills | no identity evidence loss, no fallback auth, reconciliation returns safe zero drift |
| Client boundary | Mobile/Admin mapping contract and Git diff scope check | no Mobile/Admin source change; mocks remain until owning Specs |

## Observability and Runbooks

### Metrics

- Auth verification outcomes by bounded reason; unknown key/rotation/provider
  failure; inactive/missing profile denial.
- `/me`, preference, onboarding, and device count/latency/error/version conflict.
- Webhook accepted/duplicate/rejected/conflict, inbox depth/oldest age, attempt/
  terminal failure/provider latency, reconciliation drift/lag, redaction backlog.
- Device register/revoke/current-recent-auth and linked-session retry outcome; push
  protect/register/revoke/validation outcome without token/fingerprint labels.

### Alerts

- sustained Clerk/JWKS/Supabase TPA authentication failure;
- SMS provider allowlist/configuration release failure;
- webhook signature/replay spike, oldest-age/backlog breach, terminal processing
  failure, reconciliation drift, or >7-day payload;
- linked session revoke backlog/provider outage or cross-owner token conflict;
- any secret/PII log finding, RLS negative failure, or performance budget regression.

### Runbooks

`clerk-auth-provider-recovery.md` covers provider/native-TPA validation, wrong
issuer/party, JWKS rotation/refresh delay, outage/readiness, secret rotation, and no
fallback. `clerk-webhook-device-recovery.md` covers raw verification incidents,
duplicate/conflict/out-of-order/lost delivery, reconciliation, redaction breach,
push-key rotation, device/session revoke retry, and closure evidence.

Each runbook names owner, threshold/window, severity, safe diagnostic query,
mitigation, escalation, rollback/reconciliation, and closure evidence.

## Migration, Deployment, and Rollback

- Migrations are additive and generated through Supabase CLI only after BE-001
  merge. Ordered migration/checksum/clean-state tests run before image rollout.
- Deploy migration as the existing one-off job, then API/worker images compatible
  with N-1. Do not run DDL from application startup.
- Provider Dashboard configuration is a reviewed operational procedure; database
  grants/functions/policies remain SQL-migration owned.
- Initial Clerk reconciliation is bounded/resumable and records safe counts/hashes.
- Roll back application images only. Keep all owned rows, revocation evidence,
  webhook hashes/status, and outbox events.
- Repair schema with a new forward migration. Never rewrite/drop historical
  migrations or delete profiles/tokens/inbox to recover.
- On auth/provider/config failure, keep protected traffic non-ready. Never fall back
  to Supabase Auth, shared JWT secret/template, password, mock, or unverified claims.

## Post-Design Constitution Check

*GATE: re-evaluated after Phase 1 artifacts.*

| Gate | Status | Phase 1 evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Main-first baseline / dependency | PENDING | BE-001 is present in `origin/main`; existing checkout must be transitioned to synchronized `main` and recorded before implementation |
| Artifact consistency | PASS | Spec corrections align with research, data model, OpenAPI, events, environment, provider checklist, and quickstart; tasks/analyze still next |
| Ownership completeness | PASS | Every proposed table/function/trigger/API/job/event/config is registered; no new queue/view/session/idempotency/Admin/client resource |
| Repository/client review | PASS | Reuse paths and Mobile onboarding/auth/Admin boundaries are encoded; exact merged paths must be rechecked |
| Architecture/operations | PASS | API/worker, SQL/RLS/outbox, migration, Docker, performance, observability, reconciliation, rollback/recovery all have design/evidence |
| Financial/idempotency/version | PASS | No finance; versions and natural repeatability explicit; false hash-mismatch claim removed |
| Security | PASS | Official verification, native TPA, claims/RLS, active status, least grants, webhook replay/crypto/secrets/OWASP blockers are explicit |
| AI | PASS / N/A | No AI capability |
| Client scope | PASS | Mapping only; zero planned source path under Mobile/Admin |
| Verification thresholds | PASS | Evidence table and quickstart name commands/procedures and release-blocking outcomes |

**Post-design result**: PASS, subject to the mandatory pre-code cross-artifact
analysis. Provider SMS allowlist enforcement remains a separate production release
blocker.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Required | Approved By | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| None | N/A | N/A | N/A |

The one-row inbox/provider transaction is a documented deliberate ceiling, not a
Constitution deviation or new infrastructure. If measurement shows it fails the
connection/throughput budget, work stops for an approved Master Plan/schema change.
