# 0. Document Purpose

This document is the frontend source of truth for the Masarifi mobile application.

It converts the approved Masarifi product direction into ten implementation-ready SpecKit specifications for a shared iOS and Android application.

The document is intentionally limited to:

- Product behavior visible to the mobile user.
- Mobile information architecture.
- User journeys.
- Screen requirements.
- Design-system adaptation.
- Navigation.
- Frontend state management.
- Mock authentication.
- Mock data and mock services.
- Platform-aware Android and iOS flows.
- Accessibility.
- Testing and acceptance criteria.

The document does **not** define the production backend, database, AI provider, SMS infrastructure, email delivery service, payment provider, or production authentication implementation.

All server-dependent features must be represented in the frontend through typed contracts, mock services, simulated states, and replaceable adapters.

---

# 0.1 Product Definition

Masarifi is not only an expense tracker.

Masarifi is an automatic-first personal finance companion that helps users:

1. Capture financial activity with minimal manual work.
2. Understand where their money goes.
3. Track salary, budgets, obligations, debts, installments, and savings.
4. Receive immediate feedback when financial activity is recorded.
5. Ask a smart financial assistant questions about their own data.
6. Receive understandable reports and practical saving suggestions.

The central product promise is:

> Masarifi helps users understand and control their money with the least possible effort.

The application must remain useful even when the user disables automation or rejects permissions.

---

# 0.2 Core Product Pillars

## Pillar A — Automatic Capture

On Android, Masarifi prioritizes automatic detection of financial SMS messages after explicit user permission.

The application identifies eligible banking, transfer, installment, subscription, and payment messages, extracts transaction data, classifies the transaction, and adds it automatically when confidence is sufficient.

## Pillar B — Fast Manual Capture

Users can always add income, expenses, transfers, obligation payments, and adjustments manually.

## Pillar C — Voice Capture

Users can speak naturally about what they paid, received, transferred, or purchased.

The frontend converts the experience into a structured transaction review flow using mock speech and mock analysis services during the frontend phase.

## Pillar D — Financial Awareness

The application explains:

- How much the user owns.
- How much the user spent.
- What the user spent money on.
- What remains until the next salary.
- What obligations are due.
- How much debt remains.
- Whether budgets are on track.
- How savings goals are progressing.

## Pillar E — Financial Guidance

The smart assistant answers questions based on the user’s Masarifi data and provides contextual financial analysis and saving suggestions.

It must not silently change financial records.

---

# 0.3 Approved Scope Decisions

The following decisions are approved and must guide every specification:

- The project is frontend-only in this phase.
- Authentication is fully represented in the UI using mock services.
- Sign-in methods include phone-based authentication and Google sign-in.
- Android automatic transaction tracking is a primary product feature.
- Android tracking uses the SMS permission flow as the main onboarding priority.
- Automatically detected clear transactions are added automatically.
- Unclear or conflicting transactions are sent to a review queue.
- Every automatic addition provides a visible undo or edit path.
- Users can add, remove, disable, and restore financial keywords.
- Voice transaction capture is a primary feature.
- Reports are a dedicated major section.
- Reports support monthly, three-month, half-year, and annual periods.
- Users can configure automatic report delivery by email.
- Obligations are one primary section containing debts, installments, loans, recurring bills, subscriptions, and upcoming payments.
- Obligation payments detected from SMS must update both the transaction ledger and the related obligation.
- Users can manually record monthly installment payments.
- Notifications exist both inside the application and on the phone.
- The smart assistant is a core feature, not a future experiment.
- Investments are Post-MVP.
- Camera access, receipt photography, and in-app receipt scanning are excluded.
- The application must not promise Android SMS behavior on iOS.
- iOS must provide honest alternative capture paths such as manual entry, voice entry, and approved platform automation flows.
- The mobile application reuses the approved Masarifi design foundations but does not copy the Admin Dashboard layout.

# SPEC-001 — Product Foundation, Scope, and UX Principles

## 1. Objective

Define the immutable product and user-experience rules that every mobile feature must follow.

This spec exists to prevent the mobile application from becoming a collection of disconnected finance screens.

## 2. Primary User Problem

Users often know their salary but do not know:

- Where money disappears during the month.
- Which categories consume the largest share.
- How much remains before the next salary.
- How many obligations are still unpaid.
- Whether debt is decreasing.
- Whether current spending supports savings goals.

Manual expense tracking creates friction and is abandoned quickly.

Masarifi must reduce this friction through automatic capture, voice entry, progressive setup, contextual notifications, and clear financial summaries.

## 3. Product Experience Principles

### 3.1 Automatic First, Manual Always Available

Automation is the preferred path, but users must never be blocked when automation fails.

Every automatic feature requires a manual fallback.

### 3.2 One Screen, One Primary Goal

Each screen must answer one main question or support one main action.

Examples:

- Home: What is my financial position now?
- Transactions: How did my money move?
- Reports: What happened during this period?
- Obligations: What do I still owe?
- Savings: How close am I to my goal?
- Assistant: What should I understand or do next?

### 3.3 Progressive Disclosure

Do not show advanced options before they are needed.

Advanced filters, technical tracking settings, parser details, and complex financial options should appear only after user intent is clear.

### 3.4 Progressive Onboarding

The user must not be forced to enter a complete financial profile before receiving value.

Android automatic tracking setup takes priority over asking for salary, budget, debt, or savings information.

### 3.5 Trust Through Reversibility

Any automatic financial change must support:

- Undo.
- Edit.
- View source.
- Report incorrect detection.

### 3.6 No Hidden Financial Changes

The assistant may suggest actions, but it may not create, modify, or delete financial records without explicit user confirmation.

### 3.7 Honest Platform Differences

Android and iOS must share the same product identity, but not pretend to have identical operating-system capabilities.

### 3.8 Calm, Non-Judgmental Language

The interface must not shame users.

Avoid language such as:

- “You failed.”
- “Your spending is bad.”
- “You wasted money.”

Prefer:

- “Spending is higher than your usual range.”
- “You are close to your selected limit.”
- “Here is one possible way to reduce this category.”

### 3.9 Financial Clarity Before Decoration

Amounts, dates, account names, statuses, and next actions must be visually clearer than illustrations or decoration.

### 3.10 Privacy by Design

The user must understand:

- What permission is requested.
- Why it is needed.
- What data is analyzed.
- How to disable the feature.
- How to remove local data.

## 4. Global Frontend States

Every async screen and important component must support:

- Initial.
- Loading.
- Success.
- Empty.
- Error.
- Offline.
- Partial data.
- Permission required.
- Permission denied.
- Permission permanently denied.
- Sync pending.
- Sync failed.
- Read-only.
- Disabled.
- Archived.

## 5. Core Frontend Success Measures

The UX should be designed to support these outcomes:

- A returning user can understand their current financial position within seconds.
- Manual expense entry requires minimal fields.
- Voice capture reaches a reviewable transaction quickly.
- Automatic SMS transactions appear without requiring confirmation when confidence is high.
- Incorrect automatic transactions can be corrected or undone immediately.
- Users can understand obligation progress without doing manual calculations.
- Reports clearly compare periods.
- The assistant explains numbers rather than repeating them.
- Permission-denied users still receive a complete usable application.

## 6. Global Acceptance Criteria

- The application works in Arabic RTL and English LTR.
- Every core feature has loading, empty, error, and offline states.
- No camera entry point exists.
- No receipt scanner entry point exists.
- Investments do not appear in Core V1 navigation.
- Android automatic tracking is visible as a primary value proposition.
- iOS does not show an Android SMS permission flow.
- All automatic financial changes expose undo or correction.
- All critical forms preserve entered data if the user navigates away accidentally.
- Sensitive values can be hidden globally.
- All amounts and dates use English numerals according to the approved product design rule.

## 7. Out of Scope

- Backend authorization.
- Financial calculation source of truth.
- Real SMS parsing.
- Real AI.
- Real email sending.
- Real payment processing.

# SPEC-005 — Automatic Transaction Capture and Platform-Specific Tracking

## 1. Objective

Define the complete frontend experience for automatic transaction detection, especially Android SMS tracking, while preserving honest iOS behavior.

## 2. Android Automatic SMS Tracking

Android automatic tracking is a core product feature.

The product flow is:

```text
Eligible SMS received
→ Local eligibility check
→ Structured analysis
→ Transaction extraction
→ Merchant and category mapping
→ Duplicate check
→ Automatic addition when clear
→ Review queue when uncertain
→ Notification and undo
```

The frontend phase simulates this flow with typed mock events.

## 3. Tracking Status Screen

The tracking status screen displays:

- Tracking enabled or disabled.
- SMS permission state.
- Last detected message time.
- Last successful transaction.
- Number of transactions detected this month.
- Number requiring review.
- Active keyword count.
- Active sender count.
- Background service state.
- Last sync state.

Actions:

- Enable.
- Pause.
- Resume.
- Open permission settings.
- Manage keywords.
- Manage senders.
- Review transactions.
- Run a demo.
- Clear local tracking history.

## 4. Supported Financial Event Types

The UI must represent:

- Purchase.
- Cash withdrawal.
- Deposit.
- Salary.
- Incoming transfer.
- Outgoing transfer.
- Refund.
- Reversal.
- Bank fee.
- Subscription payment.
- Installment payment.
- Failed transaction.
- Pending or held transaction.

## 5. Detected Transaction Structure

```ts
type DetectedTransaction = {
  id: string;
  source: "sms" | "voice" | "manual" | "ios-shortcut";
  type: "expense" | "income" | "transfer" | "refund" | "fee";
  status: "clear" | "review_required" | "ignored" | "failed";
  amount?: number;
  currency?: string;
  merchant?: string;
  categoryId?: string;
  subcategoryId?: string;
  accountHint?: string;
  paymentMethod?: string;
  occurredAt?: string;
  linkedObligationId?: string;
  confidence: number;
  reasons: string[];
};
```

## 6. Keyword Management

Keywords are grouped and editable.

The user can:

- Add custom keywords.
- Delete custom keywords.
- Disable default keywords.
- Re-enable keywords.
- Restore default packs.
- View Arabic and English packs.
- Search.
- See how many recent detections used a keyword.

Keywords must not imply that the application reads only those messages at the permission layer.

The privacy copy should explain that matching and filtering happen inside Masarifi after permission is granted.

## 7. Sender and Institution Management

The user can:

- View recognized financial senders.
- Enable or disable sender rules.
- Add a sender label.
- Associate a sender with a bank or provider.
- Search senders.
- Mark a sender as trusted.
- Remove a custom sender.
- View unknown sender review items.

## 8. Automatic Addition Rules in the UX

A transaction may be automatically added when the mock analyzer reports:

- Clear successful financial event.
- Single unambiguous amount.
- Known or valid currency.
- No duplicate.
- No failure wording.
- No OTP pattern.
- Sufficient transaction type confidence.
- Sufficient merchant or category confidence.
- Account match is known or optional.

## 9. Review Queue

A detected item enters review when:

- More than one amount exists.
- Transaction status is unclear.
- Merchant is unknown.
- Category confidence is low.
- The message may represent a reversal.
- Duplicate probability exists.
- More than one obligation may match.
- Account is ambiguous.
- The user’s rules conflict.

Review actions:

- Confirm.
- Edit.
- Link to account.
- Select category.
- Link to obligation.
- Keep both.
- Merge.
- Ignore.
- Report wrong detection.

## 10. Duplicate Warning

The comparison screen shows:

- New detected transaction.
- Existing possible match.
- Amount.
- Time.
- Merchant.
- Account.
- Source.
- Reasons for matching.

Actions:

- Keep existing.
- Keep new.
- Keep both.
- Merge details.

## 11. Obligation Matching

When a message appears to be a debt, installment, Tabby, Tamara, loan, or recurring payment:

The frontend must attempt to display a suggested obligation match based on:

- Provider.
- Amount.
- Due date.
- Account.
- Last four digits.
- Merchant reference.
- Installment position.

If one clear obligation matches:

- Add the transaction.
- Add an obligation payment.
- Update paid amount.
- Update remaining amount.
- Update completed installment count.
- Update next due date.
- Notify the user.

If multiple obligations match:

- Send to review.

## 12. Automatic Addition Notification

Example:

> Added SAR 250 at Netflix under Entertainment.

Actions:

- Undo.
- Edit.
- View.

Obligation example:

> Recorded SAR 2,500 for Car Installment. SAR 42,500 remains.

Actions:

- View obligation.
- Undo.
- Edit.

## 13. Permission Recovery

States:

- Not requested.
- Granted.
- Denied.
- Permanently denied.
- Disabled from system settings.
- Tracking paused.
- Service interrupted.
- Battery restriction warning.

Each state requires a specific explanation and action.

## 14. iOS Alternative Experience

iOS must not show direct SMS tracking.

Instead it provides:

- Manual transaction entry.
- Voice entry.
- Optional Shortcuts setup.
- Optional App Intents.
- Optional Share Extension.
- Quick actions.
- Widget configuration.
- Clear explanation of platform limitations.

The visual language must remain equal in quality to Android without implying equal SMS access.

## 15. Acceptance Criteria

- Android users can understand, enable, pause, and recover SMS tracking.
- Users can edit keywords and senders.
- Clear mock messages are added automatically.
- Ambiguous messages enter review.
- Duplicate handling is represented.
- Obligation payments update both relevant areas.
- Every automatic addition supports undo.
- iOS never shows an Android SMS permission.
- Tracking remains optional.
- The app remains usable after permission denial.

# SPEC-006 — Voice Transaction Capture and Smart Categorization UX

## 1. Objective

Allow users to record natural speech describing financial activity and convert it into one or more reviewable transactions.

## 2. Example User Statements

- “I paid 80 riyals for fuel in cash.”
- “I paid 250 riyals for Netflix using my Al Rajhi card.”
- “I transferred 500 riyals to Ahmed from my bank account.”
- “I received my salary of 7,000 riyals in Alinma.”
- “Yesterday I paid 40 riyals for coffee and 120 riyals for groceries.”
- “Record this month’s car installment, 2,500 riyals.”

## 3. Voice Flow

```text
Open voice entry
→ Request microphone permission

## 6. Payment Method vs Account

The UI must distinguish:

- Funding account: Al Rajhi debit card, cash wallet, Alinma account.

Example:

```text
Payment method: Apple Pay
Funding account: Al Rajhi Card
```

## 7. Missing Information

If the voice statement omits a non-required value, the app should not block saving.

Example:

> “I bought coffee for 20 riyals.”

The frontend may suggest:

- Cash.
- Last used card.
- Choose account.
- Save without account.

## 8. Multiple Transactions

One recording may create multiple proposed transactions.

Example:

> “I paid 40 for fuel and 25 for coffee.”

The review screen must show separate cards with:

- Individual edit.
- Remove.
- Confirm all.
- Confirm selected.
- Re-record.

## 9. Recurring and Obligation Detection

If the statement contains:

- Monthly.
- Every week.
- Installment.
- Subscription.
- Rent.
- Loan payment.

The UI may suggest:

- Create a recurring transaction.
- Link to an existing obligation.
- Create a new obligation.
- Record as a one-time payment.

No recurring item is created without confirmation.

## 10. Smart Categorization UX

The categorization order represented by the frontend is:

```text
User rule
→ Known merchant rule
→ Keyword rule
→ Smart analysis suggestion
→ User confirmation when uncertain
```

When the user changes a category, show:

> Always use this category for this merchant?

Options:

- Yes.
- Only this time.
- Not now.

## 11. Frontend Mock Analyzer

```ts
interface VoiceAnalyzer {
  transcribe(audioReference: string): Promise<VoiceTranscript>;
  analyze(transcript: string): Promise<DetectedTransaction[]>;
}
```

Required mock scenarios:

- Clear single transaction.
- Missing account.
- Unknown merchant.
- Multiple transactions.
- Income.

- Update balances.
- Update budgets.
- Update reports.
- Update obligations if linked.

## 3. Architecture Principles

- Feature-based organization.
- Typed contracts.
- Replaceable service adapters.
- No direct AI provider calls.
- No direct database access.
- No service-role secrets.
- No business rules hidden in UI components.
- UI components remain presentational where possible.
- Financial domain values use explicit types.
- Async state uses TanStack Query.
- Local UI and session state use Zustand.
- Forms use React Hook Form and Zod.
- Sensitive local session values use SecureStore.
- Platform logic is isolated behind adapters.
- Mock and production adapters share interfaces.

## 4. Service Interfaces

### Authentication

```ts
interface AuthService {
  signInWithPhone(phone: string): Promise<MockOtpSession>;
  verifyOtp(sessionId: string, code: string): Promise<AuthResult>;
  signInWithGoogle(): Promise<AuthResult>;
  signOut(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Transactions

```ts
interface TransactionService {
  list(filters: TransactionFilters): Promise<Transaction[]>;
  get(id: string): Promise<Transaction>;
  create(input: CreateTransactionInput): Promise<Transaction>;
  update(id: string, input: UpdateTransactionInput): Promise<Transaction>;
  remove(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Tracking

```ts
interface TrackingService {
  getStatus(): Promise<TrackingStatus>;
  requestPermission(): Promise<PermissionResult>;
  analyzeMockSms(message: string): Promise<DetectedTransaction[]>;
  updateKeywords(input: KeywordRuleInput[]): Promise<void>;
  pause(): Promise<void>;
  resume(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Voice

```ts
interface VoiceService {
  transcribe(audioReference: string): Promise<VoiceTranscript>;
  analyze(transcript: string): Promise<DetectedTransaction[]>;
}
```

### Assistant

```ts
interface AssistantService {
  ask(input: AssistantQuestion): Promise<AssistantResponse>;
  previewAction(actionId: string): Promise<AssistantActionPreview>;

```ts
interface ReportService {
  getReport(period: ReportPeriod): Promise<FinancialReport>;
  scheduleEmail(input: ReportScheduleInput): Promise<ReportSchedule>;

}
```

## 5. Mock Data Requirements

Mock data must include:

- New user.
- User without accounts.
- User with multiple accounts.
- User with salary.
- User without salary.
- User within budget.
- User near budget limit.
- User over budget.
- User with debts.
- User with Tabby or Tamara installments.
- User with overdue obligation.
- User with savings goals.
- User with completed goal.
- SMS transaction.
- Duplicate transaction.
- Failed transaction.
- Refund.
- Salary message.
- Installment message.
- Voice transaction.
- Multiple voice transactions.
- Low-confidence classification.
- Assistant insight.
- Report email success and failure.
- Notification permission denied.

## 6. State Management Rules

### TanStack Query

Use for:

- Transaction lists.
- Accounts.
- Reports.
- Obligations.
- Notifications.
- Assistant conversations.
- Subscription state.
- Mock async mutations.

### Zustand

Use for:

- Session shell state.
- Selected language.
- Theme.
- Hidden balance preference.
- Onboarding progress.
- Permission walkthrough state.
- Draft transaction.
- Voice recording state.
- Unsynced local items.
- Temporary undo queue.

Do not duplicate the same server-shaped data in both systems.

## 7. Offline and Sync UX

Required states:

- Offline banner.
- Pending sync badge.
- Local transaction created.
- Retry.
- Sync failed.
- Conflict.
- Last sync time.
- Sync center.
- Restored connection.
- Background sync paused.

Rules:

- Manual entries may be saved locally.
- Automatic mock tracking events can appear as pending sync.
- The user must not lose entered data.
- Conflict resolution must be understandable.
- The frontend must not pretend an item is synced when it is not.

## 8. Localization

- Arabic and English are first-class product languages.
- Neither language may receive partial screens, missing content, reduced functionality, or lower visual quality.
- Arabic uses RTL layouts.
- English uses LTR layouts.
- No hard-coded user-facing strings.
- Layout direction follows locale.
- Icons with directional meaning mirror when appropriate.
- Numbers and dates remain English numerals.
- Currency formatting must be locale-aware but consistent with product rules.
- Arabic financial terms must be reviewed for clarity.
- Truncation must not hide amounts or statuses.

## 9. Accessibility

Required:

- Screen-reader labels.
- Clear focus order.
- Dynamic font support.
- Sufficient contrast.
- Non-color status indicators.
- Accessible chart summaries.
- Large touch targets.
- Reduced motion.
- Haptic alternatives are not required for understanding.
- Inputs have labels, not placeholders only.
- Error messages identify the field and correction.
- Voice entry has text alternatives.
- Permission flows are understandable without illustrations.

## 10. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Formatters.
- Validators.
- Category mapping.
- State reducers.
- Undo queue.
- Report period selection.
- Obligation progress calculations for mock display.
- Permission-state mapping.

### Component Tests

- Transaction item.
- Amount input.
- Account selector.
- Category selector.
- Keyword editor.
- Notification card.
- Obligation progress.
- Report summary.
- Assistant action preview.
- Voice review card.

### Screen Tests

- Sign in.
- Android tracking onboarding.
- Home.
- Transaction list.
- Add transaction.
- Voice capture.
- Obligation detail.
- Reports.
- Notifications.
- Assistant conversation.
- Settings.

### Integration Flows

- Phone sign-in mock.
- Google sign-in mock.
- Android SMS permission granted.
- Android SMS permission denied.
- Auto-add clear transaction.

- Dark mode.
- Small phone.
- Large phone.
- Keyboard open.
- Long Arabic text.
- Large accessibility text.
- Hidden balances.
- Empty data.
- Dense data.
- Offline.
- Permission denied.
- Loading skeletons.
- Bottom sheets.
- Safe areas.

## 12. Performance Rules

- Avoid rendering all transactions at once.
- Use list virtualization.
- Memoize expensive derived presentation data.
- Avoid unnecessary global re-renders.
- Defer non-critical dashboard sections.
- Keep startup shell lightweight.
- Do not block navigation on optional mock requests.
- Optimize chart rendering.
- Avoid oversized images and animations.

## 13. Analytics Event Plan

Frontend event names should be defined without sending production analytics yet.

Examples:

- `auth_phone_started`
- `auth_google_started`
- `tracking_intro_viewed`
- `tracking_permission_granted`
- `tracking_permission_skipped`
- `tracking_keyword_added`
- `transaction_auto_added`
- `transaction_auto_undone`
- `transaction_review_completed`
- `voice_recording_started`
- `voice_transaction_saved`
- `obligation_payment_recorded`
- `report_period_changed`
- `report_email_scheduled`
- `assistant_question_sent`
- `assistant_action_confirmed`

No sensitive financial amount should be included in analytics payloads.

## 14. Error Handling

Every feature must map technical errors to user actions.

Examples:

- Try again.
- Save locally.
- Open settings.
- Review manually.
- Contact support.
- Continue without feature.

Do not show raw stack traces or provider errors.

## 15. Definition of Done

A spec is complete only when:

- Screens are implemented.
- RTL and LTR are verified.
- Light and dark modes are verified.
- Loading, empty, error, offline, and permission states exist.
- Mock services are typed.
- Forms are validated.
- Accessibility labels exist.
- Tests pass.
- No production secret exists.
- No camera feature was introduced.
- No unsupported iOS SMS claim exists.
- Automatic actions expose undo or correction.
- Design tokens are used.
- Visual QA is complete.

## 16. Recommended Execution Order

1. SPEC-001.
2. SPEC-002.
3. SPEC-003.
4. SPEC-004.
5. SPEC-005.
6. SPEC-006.
7. SPEC-007.
8. SPEC-008.
9. SPEC-009.
10. SPEC-010 final hardening.

## 17. Final Frontend Acceptance

The complete frontend must demonstrate this end-to-end product story:

```text
User signs in
→ Android user enables SMS tracking or iOS user selects an alternative path
→ Financial activity is added automatically, by voice, or manually
→ Accounts and transactions update
→ Budgets and reports update
→ Obligation payments update debt or installment progress
→ The user receives a phone and in-app notification
→ The smart assistant can explain the updated financial position
→ The user can correct, undo, or review any uncertain result
```

---

# Final Product Statement

Masarifi Mobile is an automatic-first personal finance application for Arabic-speaking users.

Its frontend must make financial management feel effortless, trustworthy, and understandable.

The experience succeeds when users do not need to remember every transaction manually, can see exactly where their money goes, can follow debts and installments until completion, can receive useful reports automatically, and can ask a smart assistant practical questions about their own financial behavior.

The mobile application must preserve the Masarifi Gulf Premium identity while delivering a native, calm, accessible, and high-quality experience on both Android and iOS.
